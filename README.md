	 This features is useful if you are working on a responsive project or on a project with many 
	 pages and artboards.
2. Mark all artboards with wrong width caused by a mistake (ex. 322px instead of 320px)

# Feature 1: Exporting artboards
## How does it work?

   [page number].[artboard number] - [page name] - [artboard name] (es: 1.2 - My profile - My order.png)
- Grouped exported artboards in ordered folders for two different path:
    - page/device/artboard.png
    - device/page/artboard.png
